<h2>Hi there, my name is Sebastian ðŸ‘‹</h2>

I am a Data & AI manager at Avanade and PhD student at Helmholtz Munich and the Technical University of Munich.
<p>I work on developing data platforms and deep learning models to solve challenging questions in biology and medicine. My particular focus is on single-cell and spatial genomics. Check out my latest tool [NicheCompass](https://github.com/Lotfollahi-lab/nichecompass).</p>
